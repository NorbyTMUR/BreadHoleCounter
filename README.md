# BreadHoleCounter
Counting the number of holes in bread for a fun end-of-year project in chem.
<br/>Includes an abridged version of my dataset - the images are named for the loaf that they were part of and the slice number (loaf 1, slice 1: breadslice.1.0.jpg).
<br/>Loaf 1 - proofed for 1 hour
<br/>Loaf 2 - proofed for 2 hours
<br/>Loaf 3 - proofed for 3 hours
<br/>Loaf 4 - proofed for 4 hours
